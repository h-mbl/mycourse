# Course Registration System (Java Client-Server Application)

## Description

This repository contains a Java client-server application that enables students to register for courses.

## Overview

The Course Registration System is a client-server application designed to facilitate course enrollment for students. The system consists of two main components:

1. **Server**: The server is responsible for managing course information, student registrations, and handling client requests. It maintains the central database of available courses and enrolled students.

2. **Client**: The client is an application that allows students to interact with the server. Students can view the list of available courses, enroll in desired courses, and check their course registrations.

## Features

- View Available Courses: Students can view a list of all available courses along with their details, such as course code, name, instructor, and schedule.

- Course Enrollment: Students can select courses from the list of available courses and register for them. The system ensures that students do not register for conflicting courses.

- Registration Status: Students can check their course registration status to see the courses they are currently enrolled in.

## How to Use

1. **Server Setup**: Before running the application, ensure that the server is set up and running. The server should have the database of courses and student registrations.

2. **Client Application**: Run the client application on each student's computer. The application will prompt the students to enter their login credentials to access the course registration system.

3. **View Available Courses**: Upon successful login, the students can view the list of available courses along with their details.

4. **Course Enrollment**: Students can select the courses they wish to enroll in. The system will verify if there are no time conflicts with their existing course schedule.

5. **Registration Confirmation**: After successful enrollment, students will receive a confirmation message indicating their course registration.
